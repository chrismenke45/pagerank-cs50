This is some practice with uncertainty from (CS50's Pagerank)[https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/2/pagerank/]. I wrote two algorithms that find the rank of the different webpages in the corpuses based off of how many other pages reference it. One uses sampling, and tests N cases with a random number generator to find the rank. The second iterates over the pages probabilities until they converge at a value.
